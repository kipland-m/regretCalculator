First Version

    Terminal Implementation
    
    Takes two prices and compares # of shares (or coins, float value is valid)
    Very basic error checking
    Rough prototype

Second Verison

    Basic GUI Implementation

    Same function as terminal application, 3 text boxes for input 
    [Price] [Price] [Amount]


Example of use:

    First value | 131.24
    Second value | 89.21
    # of shares/coins | 40

    40 shares/coins at 131.24 equal 5249.6
    40 shares/coins at 89.21 equal 3568.4
